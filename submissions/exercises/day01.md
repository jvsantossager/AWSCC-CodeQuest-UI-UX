## **User-Experience Analysis:**

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>
    Answer: In my opinion, I find the products easier to find in Shopee, the products are sectored into colored divisions and contains categories with images or labeled icons that represent which category they belong under. while in the lazada website, it also uses images but instead of using bright colors to make it stand out, they only use white backgrounds and some line elements to divide and categorize their products.

-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>
    Answer: In my opinion, i don't find anything distracting in the websites. I think both websites did really well in their respective web designs.

-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platforms’ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/> 
    Answer: I find Shopee easeir to find and scan content. like i mentioned, Shopee uses bright colors to make some sections of the website to make it stand out amongst the other content found in the website which might make it easier for a user to understnad that those bright sections are important or they should check it out.
